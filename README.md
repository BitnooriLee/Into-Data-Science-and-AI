<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is the project output related to the Introduction to data science course offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers Univesity of Technology.

Here's what I've learned from the project:

### Knowledge and comprehension

Enumerate the core issues and methods used in data science and AI.
Present instances of how data science and AI have been used in various areas.
Provide illustrations of the use of stochastic models and machine learning (ML) in data science and AI.
Describe the fundamental ideas of traditional AI and the connection between logical and data-driven, ML-based techniques within AI.
Give a brief overview of the historical evolution of AI, what is currently possible, and potential future developments.


### Skills and abilities

Implement fundamental transformations, visualizations, and analysis of sample data using the proper programming techniques and libraries.
Find the right kinds of analytical issues for particular specific data science applications.
Apply several stochastic model types in data science and AI applications.
Use AI-tools for planning, problem-solving, and search. Implement basic machine learning techniques into a standard library.

### Judgment and strategy

Justify the type of statistical approach that is appropriate for the most prevalent sorts of experiments in applications of data science.
Discuss the benefits and cons of various data science and AI methodologies and models.
Consider the inherent limitations of data science approaches and how the improper use of statistical tools can provide ambiguous results.
Applications of data science and AI are examined critically with regard to ethics, privacy, and societal impact.
Demonstrate reflection in all of your learning
