First, in the k-armed bandit problem, we have k different options to take, each option with a different underlying probability distribution to receive a reward that is unknown at the start. In opposite to supervised learning, we don't know which option is best to get maximized reward, so. we need to find out which option is best based on previous knowledge (exploiting) or at random to find new possibilities (exploring) by trial and error. The optimal decision will probably be somewhere in between the extremes (always explore or always exploit) and will depend on the number of decisions to make. For example, if we use the greedy method that does not use any exploration, which means we always take the same option for all iterations. Instead, if we choose to explore that test-out option randomly then we can have a better chance to find the best option by seeing if there is a better alternative. \n",
